> There are no major issues with this article. Recommendation: Accepted / Minor Revision

> Introduction: Should “such as Serpent [9, 10] and ORIGEN [11], estimate…” be “such as Serpent [9,
> 10] and ORIGEN [11], that estimate…” or “such as Serpent [9, 10] and ORIGEN [11], which estimate…”?



> Introduction: “a High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor” should not be capitalized. Introduction:
> “Uncertainty Quantification” should not be capitalized.

> Background: Math tip – subscripts ‘ch’ for charged particles and “Tr” for transport should not be
> in italic. Italic font is for variables; these are identifiers on the variable .

> Background: “Pressurized Water Reactor” should not be capitalized.
> Background: Should “by radiation originated” be “by radiation originating?”
> Methodology: “SCALE Code System” should just be SCALE code system.”
> Methodology: Equation 2 is a repeat of equation 1. Units (W, MeV, s⁻¹) are not usually included in
> the equations, but if you keep them, they should not be in italics (italics is for variables).
> Units [γ/s] should just be [s⁻¹]. Constants, such as 1.6022×10⁻¹³ should also include units (W s
> MeV⁻¹).
> 
> ATR Experiment: “corner lobes” is mentioned and later “the 5 lobes” is mentioned. What exactly is a
> lobe? Are there 4, 5 or 9?
> 
> RA-6 Structures: “Boron Neutron Capture Therapy” does not need to be capitalized. “Normal Fuel
> Elements” and “Control Fuel Elements do not need to be capitalized. “8x10 array” should be “8 × 10
> array.” “x-direction” and “y-direction” should be “-direction” and “-direction.” “the rector
> operated” should be “the reactor operated.”
> RA-6 Results: The Table I captions says “Values expressed in W.” But the table lists values in
> units of W m⁻³ and unitless ratios.

> Reference 1: Should “ANS Student Conference 2022, ANS,” just be “ANS Student Conference 2022?”
> Reference 1 and 2: title of conference proceedings? page numbers? DOI links?
> Reference 3: Should this be “Transactions of the American Nuclear Society 126 (1), 352-355 (2022).

> Reference 4: Should “Research Org.:” be it there? “Lab.” should be “Laboratory.” Reference 7: “0,
> 0, 1” should be “208, 1471–1483.”
> Reference 9: Since this is a journal, should the conference information be removed? “joint” should
> be “Joint.”
> Reference 14: Authors “Grant L. Hawkes, James W. Sterbentz, and Binh T. Pham” should be listed.
